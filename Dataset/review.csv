BuzzA,"Aug 2, 2022",5.0/5,My favorite makeup item - use it every day,"I did NOT receive this item as part of a promotion :), and I very rarely write reviews. However... I bought this after first purchasing the Weekend Set and falling in love with the brand. I thought the Biscuit color would be great, as it's a cool gray-ish brown that looks much more natural than the usual orange-ish warm bronzers, and I knew that creating shadows is the best way to contour my ""seasoned"" skin. This is now my FAVORITE make-up item and I use it every day. It's so natural and glides on like butter, easy to blend even on dry skin (but I like it with a primer first). Worth the $$. Hope this helps someone else who's trying to justify the purchase.",14,Verified purchase,-
unii,"Jan 7, 2022",3.0/5,Doesn’t stay on.,"I love Westman Altelier foundation and blush sticks, I use these almost daily. But I’m not a fan of their contour stick because it doesn’t really stay on and there’s just something off about the color. For something that costs $48 per stick, it didn’t deliver. Stick with your contouring or bronzer powder.",10,Verified purchase,-

808chicsta,"Apr 21, 2023",4.0/5,Pretty and easy to use,"I purchased the Biscuit color. It’s my first contour stick. It goes on well and melts into your skin after blending it out.

I think I would have liked the truffle color better to see a bit more contour.",-,Verified purchase,-
Eva,"Apr 20, 2023",5.0/5,Worth the money,"I was really thinking long and hard before buying this, it’s quite a bit of money for a contour stick! But then my MUA showed me how to use Truffle on my fair skin as bronzer and I was sold. The color looked intimidating first but I cannot emphasise enough how well this blends. It looks like your skin and gives a beautiful sun kissed colour. I might use it more as a contour stick when I get tan this summer but however I use it, I don’t want to be without it. Well worth the money as with all these products.",-,Not verified,-

So far I’ve only had quantity problems with their lip tint which is still not going to stop me from getting one again but the insane fact is their contour stick in the shade Biscuit has made me turn away from a Chanel product that I do religiously used to use prior to buying this!

In fact, I was surprised by how quickly it blended given how rich the color was on my skin. Love the packaging with the magnetic top but given the flat top, it’s probably best to apply with a brush.

BuzzA,"Aug 2, 2022",5.0/5,My favorite makeup item - use it every day,"I did NOT receive this item as part of a promotion :), and I very rarely write reviews. However... I bought this after first purchasing the Weekend Set and falling in love with the brand. I thought the Biscuit color would be great, as it's a cool gray-ish brown that looks much more natural than the usual orange-ish warm bronzers, and I knew that creating shadows is the best way to contour my ""seasoned"" skin. This is now my FAVORITE make-up item and I use it every day. It's so natural and glides on like butter, easy to blend even on dry skin (but I like it with a primer first). Worth the $$. Hope this helps someone else who's trying to justify the purchase.",14,Verified purchase,-

ganjagirlsguide,"Oct 18, 2022",4.0/5,Great color for medium skin tone,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This was a fantastic color for a medium skin tone. The only issue I had with it is it’s meant more for skin that’s not oily at all. I’m sure this would be perfect for dry skin.,-,Not verified,-

angelab277,"Sept 25, 2022",5.0/5,I love it!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I like the smooth application and look of a cream. I draw a line along my cheek bones and on the sides of my forehead then blend them out with a flat brush and I’m left with naturally aspect, healthy looking skin. It’s quick to apply and it doesn’t smudge once blended out.",-,Not verified,https://photos-us.bazaarvoice.com/photo/2/cGhvdG86d2VzdG1hbmF0ZWxpZXI/a1fb03cc-a5ba-5040-85a1-6458c080dce8
Eliza K.,"Sept 21, 2022",5.0/5,LOVE!,"I have been using Face Trace in Biscuit to accentuate my cheek bone and it has been fantastic. My latest purchase was in the color Truffle and I use it to warm up my pale complexion, together with Baby Cheeks Blush in Mimi, and I am even more in love! Both are perfect in terms of color, texture and how they make my skin look, but I use Truffle several times a day now that it is fall in New York.",-,Not verified,-

Christensen,"Aug 25, 2022",1.0/5,Not that great.,"I had done extensive research before I purchased the biscuit contour stick. The color looks grey on my skin and sits in my pours. It does not melt like it was described and takes extensive blending to create the desired effect. For the price, I am not impressed and will not buy this product again.",-,Not verified,-

abeersa,"June 12, 2022",5.0/5,Perfect,[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Perfect for blending nicely on the skin. Enhances the contours and stays on for long.

ellewms,"June 12, 2022",4.0/5,Great little contour stick,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Nicely pigmented yet the consistency makes it super easy to blend out. In fact, I was surprised by how quickly it blended given how rich the color was on my skin. Love the packaging with the magnetic top but given the flat top, it’s probably best to apply with a brush. Very limited color range, especially for darker complexions, which is why I docked a star.",-,Not verified,-
